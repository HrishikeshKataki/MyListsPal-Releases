# 📦 MyListsPal – Official Releases

Welcome to the official release repository for **MyListsPal** — a beautifully designed, fully private, Lists app built with Flutter to help you make Lists for _anything_.

This repository is dedicated to hosting all public builds of the app across platforms.

[Why am I hosting the releases here? Mostly because I'm a student and don't have money to host it elsewhere :( ]
